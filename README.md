My first day in training is very valuable to me.Our first topic is about linux.
Linux is a operating system which is completely different from windows.
:Difference between linux and windows
   1.Linux is a open source system i.e
     anybody can download it whereas      
     windows is not a open source system.
   2.Linux is free of cost while windows 
     requires licensing which varies by 
     designing and usage.
   3.In linux,there is no money required   
     whereas windows requires purchases.
: How to download Linux
 1.Firstly we need a virtual box in which  
   we can add linux.
 2.We need a ISO file.
 3.We need to download microsoft visual 
   C++.
: Career opportunities 
  I explore more about my career that what is have to do after my degree or in my degree.
My dream is that I work in cyber security companies.
So that's it from my 1st day of training

 :Dual  booting: in this two operating system can be used in one computer.we have to choose which system to use.
 :Bare metal installation:Installing an operating system directly on physical computer,not inside VMware.The operating system can be installed using pen drive.
 :Meta installation:Installing a package that installs many other related packages.we install one thing,it brings bunch of things with it.
 :Partitioning Scheme:Dividing hard disk into sections so that each part can be used for different purpose.Linux uses multiple partitions to keep the system organised,secure and flexible.
