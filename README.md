My first day in training is very valuable to me.Our first topic is about linux.
Linux is a operating system which is completely different from windows.
:Difference between linux and windows
   1.Linux is a open source system i.e
     anybody can download it whereas      
     windows is not a open source system.
   2.Linux is free of cost while windows 
     requires licensing which varies by 
     designing and usage.
   3.In linux,there is no money required   
     whereas windows requires purchases.
: How to download Linux
 1.Firstly we need a virtual box in which  
   we can add linux.
 2.We need a ISO file.
 3.We need to download microsoft visual 
   C++.
