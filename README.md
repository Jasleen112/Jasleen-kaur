Day 1 of training in my CSE department 
 
My first day in training is very valuable to me.Our first topic is about linux.
Linux is a operating system which is completely different from windows.

     anybody can download it whereas      
     windows is not a open source system.
   2.Linux is free of cost while windows 
     requires licensing which varies by 
     designing and usage.
   3.In linux,there is no money required   
     whereas windows requires purchases.

   we can add linux.
